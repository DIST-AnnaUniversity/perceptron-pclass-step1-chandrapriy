# m-class
<ol>
<li>Create a new python file with name step1.py. Within this file have a function with name test_step1.py. In this function, work out the three class linear perceptron problem. <\li>

<li>Inputs are y = np.array([[10,2,-1],[2,-5,-1],[-5,5,-1],])<\li>

<li>Initial weights are w = np.array([[1,-2,0],[0,-1,2],[1,3,-1],])<\li>

<li>teacher values  d = np.array([[1,-1,-1],[-1,1,-1],[-1,-1,1],])<\li>

<li>Return the weight after step1 (Note here, this is the starting point)<\li>

<li>On pushing your code to the repository, you should get a tick mark indicating that you have got right answer. In such case, go to the next part of the assignment - perceptron-3-class-full<\li>
